                    <li>1.5 Cup Flour</li>
                    <li>2 Tablespoon Turmeric Latte Blend</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, add all the ingredients together. Wisk until combined well and keep aside.</li>
                    <li>Heat non-stick pan over medium-low heat, brush some oil on the surface of the pan when pan its hot. Pour about 1/3 cup of batter on the pan gently spread it as evenly and wide as possible. 
                        The trick is to hold a pan from the handle and rotate the batter all over the pan into a thin layer.</li>
                    <li>Create a thin layer of the batter and spread some oil on the sides of the pan if it gets sticky. 
                        Cook for few seconds until the batter appears to show some bubbles on top and it changes its colour.</li>
                    <li>Flip crepe over, cook for a few more seconds then remove from heat and repeat the same until you use the entire batter.</li>
                    <li>Serve crepes with berry compote, passion fruit syrup, coconut cream and fresh seasonal fruits of your choice.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use any non-stick pan to make these crepes no crepe pan needed.</li>
                    <li>Make sure you make crepes on low medium heat, and if you see crepes bit sticky on side you can drizzle some oil on the side of the pan and then flip.</li>
                    <li>I add jaggery as my sugar alternative but it is entirely up to you what you wish to add as your sugar substitute.</li>
